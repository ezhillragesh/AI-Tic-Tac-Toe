## How it Works

The AI opponent in this game uses the minimax strategy to determine its moves. Minimax is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in two-player turn-based games like Tic-Tac-Toe. The AI evaluates all possible future moves and their outcomes to find the best move that maximizes its chances of winning or minimizing its chances of losing. This makes the AI a tough opponent to beat, as it considers various scenarios ahead of time.
